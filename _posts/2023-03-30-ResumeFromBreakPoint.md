# Resuming DownLoads from a Break-Point in Swift

Downloading large files can be a challenge, especially on mobile devices with unstable network connections or limited data plans. Fortunately, modern web servers support range requests, which allow clients to request only a portion of a file, and can be used to resume downloads from the point where they were interrupted. In this post, we'll explore how to implement resumable downloads in a Swift app, using URLSessionDownloadTask and resume data.

## The problem with downloads

Downloading large files can be difficult, especially on mobile devices with limited bandwidth or unstable network connections. A download may be interrupted for any number of reasons, including network timeouts, connectivity issues, or user intervention (e.g., putting the device to sleep). When this happens, the user may have to start the download from scratch, which can be frustrating and wasteful, especially if they've already downloaded a significant portion of the file.

## Using resume data to resume downloads

To resume a download from a break-point, we need to use resume data, which is essentially a snapshot of the download's state at the time it was interrupted. When a download is interrupted, the server sends back a special response code (206 Partial Content), along with the portion of the file that was successfully downloaded. The client (i.e., our app) can then use this information to resume the download from the point where it left off, by sending a new request that includes a Range header indicating the portion of the file that needs to be downloaded.

To use resume data to resume a download, we first need to save it to disk when the download is interrupted. This can be done using the cancel(byProducingResumeData:) method of URLSessionDownloadTask, which takes a closure that is called with the resume data when the download is cancelled. We can then save this resume data to disk (e.g., in the app's Documents directory), and use it to resume the download later.

```swift
func pauseDownload() {
    guard let downloadTask = (URLSession.shared.downloadTasks.first { $0.currentRequest?.url == url }) else {
        return
    }
    downloadTask.cancel { resumeData in
        DispatchQueue.main.async {
            try! resumeData?.write(to: destinationURL)
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementing resumable downloads in Swift

To implement resumable downloads in a Swift app, we first need to set up a URLSessionDownloadTask, which is a subclass of URLSessionTask that is specifically designed for downloading files. We can create a download task by calling the downloadTask(with:) method of URLSession, passing in a URLRequest that specifies the URL of the file to be downloaded.

Once we have a download task, we can start the download by calling its resume() method. This will send a new request to the server, and begin downloading the file from the beginning. If the download is interrupted, we can cancel the task using the cancel(byProducingResumeData:) method, which will call a closure with the resume data. We can then save this resume data to disk (e.g., using the FileManager API), and use it to resume the download later.

To resume a download from the resume data, we first need to read the resume data from disk. We can do this using the Data(contentsOf:) method of Data, passing in the URL of the file where the resume data was saved. Once we have the resume data, we can create a new download task using the downloadTask(withResumeData:) method of URLSession, passing in the resume data as a parameter. We can then call the resume() method on the new task, and the download will resume from the point where it left off.

```Swift
func resumeDownload() {
    guard let resumeData = try? Data(contentsOf: destinationURL) else {
        return
    }
    let downloadTask = URLSession.shared.downloadTask(withResumeData: resumeData)
    downloadTask.resume()
}
```

## Conclusion

Resumable downloads are an important feature for any app that needs to download large files. By using range requests and resume data, we can make downloads more robust and efficient, and provide a better user experience. In this post, we've explored how to implement resumable downloads in a Swift app, using URLSessionDownloadTask and resume data. By using these tools, we can provide our users with a seamless downloading experience, even in the face of network disruptions and other interruptions.
